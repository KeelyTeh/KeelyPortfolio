									<h2>Introduction</h2></br>
									<h3>Problem:</h3>
									<p>Many US Midwestern states have been negatively affected by drought in the past few years. My goal in this analysis
										was to determine what crops have suffered or thrived in these conditions and to uncover new insights that would help
										future growing seasons.
									</p>
									<h3>Context:</h3>
									<p>I carried out this analysis on my own, before enrolling in CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program. The purpose of this project was to become familiar with data cleaning, 
										analysis, visualization, and automation tasks commonly used by data analysts. Also, important to note, I can no longer access my Power BI dashboard, only my visualizations and source data, because 
										my business email associated with my account has changed. However, I have made an effort to provide a case study that demonstrates my process and results.</p>
									<h3>Goal:</h3>
									<p>My goal for this analysis was to provide needed evidence regarding what crops survived and thrived recent drought conditions. Doing so helped inform farmers what crops to 
										plant during mild to moderate droughts.

											<h3>Extensive Data Cleaning & Transformation:</h3>
											<p>I encountered the need extensive data cleaning and transformation for this project. In the visuals below,
												the orginal state crop production data sets contained multiple crops, both amounts planted and harvested, and many different units.
												Here, I only kept units per acre and total crop units, and I had to transform rows into columns and make other adjustments to clean and organize this data. The second
												photo shows the various drought levels in the Drought Monitor data I categorized into fewer categories and put the total acres of each drought level: which I recall was
												no drought, dry to moderate, and severe to exceptional drought.

											<h3>Visualizations:</h3>
											<p>At the time I created these visualizations, my intention was to allow interested individuals to use the buttons,
												much like using an app, to easily navigate to information of interest to them: crops, state, county, etc. You can see below
												how the buttons allow the user to customize their report.

											<h2>Recommendations</h2></br>
											<h3>Primary Insights:</h3>
											<div class="row">
												<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
													<ul>
														<li>Most crops, especially corn, have seen significant decreases in production
															throughout dry to moderate conditions as well as severe to exceptional drought conditions. Some crops, however, have 
															only seen production decreases during extreme drought conditions but not dry to moderate. More drastic measures may need to be
															put in place for successful growing seasons, such as irrigation, planting drought resistant crops, or IoT fertigation 
															(a crop production method used in Japan). 
														</li>
														<li>Cotton has done exceptionally well in dry to moderate drought conditions, as well
															as winter wheat. If after calculating percent yield the results are still positive, it is recommended that these two crops be planted during seasons that are forecasted 
															to have dry to moderate drought conditions, as long as the other environmental factors are suitable for growing these crops.
														</li>
														<li>The Midwest states hit hardest by extreme drought conditions have been the western part
															of the region, especially in North Dakota and South Dakota. More drastic measures may need to be
															put in place for successful growing seasons, such as irrigation, planting drought resistant crops, or IoT fertigation.
														</li>

														<div class="col-12"><span class="centerImage"><img src="images/kansas_cotton.jpg" width=550 text-align="center" alt="" /></span><figcaption>Cotton production was up during moderate drought conditions, </br>but it would also be good to see the amount that was planted these years.</figcaption></div>
														<div class="col-12"><span class="centerImage"><img src="images/winter_wheat.jpg" width=550 text-align="center" alt="" /></span><figcaption>Winter wheat production was also up during moderate drought conditions.</figcaption></div>

												</div></br>																		
											</section>
											<blockquote><h4>Retrospective:</h4>
												<p>If I were to redo this analysis, I would be sure to calculate percent yield or weighted average of units per acre for each crop. For example,
													this would be the sum of units per acre x by the number of acres planted / sum of number of acres planted. I would have replaced the total units in the clustered bar/line chart 
													with the weighted average, which would have been a better measure of the portion of crops that thrived. For example, 
													cotton and winter wheat seemed to do well in moderate drought conditions, but it could be that more farmers planted these crops, leading
													to higher overall yields during 2020 and 2021. Also, it may be necessary to observe crop production of cotton and wheat multiple years and states to draw a conclusion. 
													Literature review or data analysis could also be conducted on cotton and winter wheat production and climate data from other sources, if available, before drawing final conclusions.</br></br> Also, my storytelling and visualization skills have dramatically improved
													since taking CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program, so now I would have the visualizations more clearly show which crops thrived in drought conditions
													and which ones suffered. I would also include clear conclusions and recommendations in the visualizations.
