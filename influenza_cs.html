									<h2>Introduction</h2></br>
									<h3>Problem:</h3>
									<p>Every year in the US, extra demands are placed on hospitals and clinics during flu season, leading to
										staffing shortages and undesirable health outcomes because of those staffing shortages. 
									</p>
									<h3>Context:</h3>
									<p>I carried out this analysis as a student for a project in CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program. The purpose of this project was to become familiar with Tableau and Excel skills commonly used by data analysts.
										The project also enabled me to put all the analytics pieces together:

									<h3>Goal:</h3>
									<p>My goal was to help mitigate medical staffing shortages in hospitals and clinics across the US during flu season.
										By using deaths and population data, I determined the regions and seasons of greatest need, so the correct amount
										of staff could be sent to the right locations at the right times of the year.

									<h3>Designing a Research Project:</h3>
									<p>In this step, I created a project management plan. This plan laid out
										project timelines, modes of communication with stakeholders, potential hypotheses, and other important project components.
										Initially, there were several written hypotheses, but only one was chosen after looking at the available data
										sources and conducting exploratory data analyis. For example, hypotheses regarding vaccine rates were not explored
										because death statistics predominately affected the elderly and vaccine data only contained information on children.</p>
										<blockquote><h4>Hypothesis:</h4>
											<p>Hypothesis: If an individual is older than 65 years of age or less than 5 years of age, then that individual has a greater chance of hospitalization or death 
												as a result of infection with the flu.</p></blockquote>									
									<p>To view the project management plan, click <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-PEWVR3Fps5e7btvzCcuk_wOnn4NATXT/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
									<h3>Data Integrity & Quality:</h3>
									<p>When addressing data integrity issues, one of the most important things I did was use Excel formulas to look for extreme
										values, check value counts, and ensure the number of unique values had expected counts. One of the data integrity issues seen below
										is the presence of too many state names in the original CDC Influenza Deaths data set. That is because both state names and abbreviations were used.
										This was later changed, so the data set only included full state names.</br></br>
										During the data quality checks, I primarily focused on checking for missing values and duplicate records. Here, I found that
										there were many suppressed records in the original CDC Influenza data set in all age groups except the top 2-3 oldest age categories. This is because the government
										suppresses data when there are fewer than 10 records because of privacy issues. I imputed the median of 10, which is 5, for these
										records. In reality, the death rate for these records is likely lower, just to keep in mind when viewing the recommendations
										and visualizations later in this case study.</p>

											</div>
										</div></section></br>
									<h3>Statistical Analysis:</h3>
									<p>I calculated some basic descriptive statistics in Excel, such as mean and standard deviation. I also made frequency
										distribution charts for the percentage of the population over 65 years of age and the distribution of death percentage of that same age group.
										Finally, I conducted a two-sample t-test in Excel to determine if my hypothesis was correct, that there were more deaths in the under 5/65+
										age groups than there were in the rest of the population. After running the t-test, the conclusion was that there was a significant difference between the death rate of the vulnerable age groups
										and all other age groups.</p>
										<blockquote><h4>Null & Alternative Hypotheses:</h4>
											<p>I divided the main hypothesis at the beginning of this process section into two statements to help determine the direction
												of my two-sample t-test results.</p>
												<div class="row">
													<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
														<ul>
															<li>Null Hypothesis: The flu-related death rate in US populations of people under 5/65+ is equal to or less than the death rate in all other age groups.</li>
															<li>Alternative Hypothesis: There is a higher flu-related death rate in the US in the under 5/65+ age groups than for other age groups in the US population.</li>
														</ul>
													</div>
												</div>
											<h4>Two-Sample T-Test:</h4>
											<p>From this analysis, I rejected the null hypothesis that the death rate for the vulnerable age groups is equal or less than the death rate of the other 
												age groups. This means that the death rate for the vulnerable population is greater than the death rate for other age groups, with
												with a p-value of 1.81 E-138, which is scientific notation. This p-value is much smaller than the my chosen alpha of 0.05, so I rejected the null.
												The fact that there was a significant difference in deaths rates of the population groups gave context to the Tableau analysis and visualizations 
												discussed in the following recommendations section.</p>

									<h2>Recommendations</h2></br>
									<h3>US Flu Season:</h3>
									<p>Flu is seaonal across the US with minor variations among regions. Flu deaths begin to increase in October, with peaks in January
										and often March, then decline after that. Because of this, October through March, additional staff should be sent
										to hospitals and clinics. 
									</p>

											<div class="col-12"><span class="centerImage"><img src="images/Flu temporal chart.jpg" width=600 text-align="center" alt="" /></span><figcaption>The annual peak in US flu deaths from October through March can be seen here.</figcaption></div>
										</div>
									</div></br>
									<h3>Regions of Greatest Need:</h3>
									<p>States with high populations and especially those with high populations of individuals over 65 years of age, experience the
										greatest impact and number of deaths from the flu. For this reason, these states should have higher priority when allocating
										additional staff during the US flu season.
									</p>
									<div style="text-align: center;">
										<div class="row gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="centerImage"><img src="images/map_deaths_population.jpg" width=600 text-align="center" alt="" /></span><figcaption>States that are darker in red have higher death rates. The circles represent </br>population; the
												greater the state population, the larger the circle.
											</figcaption></div>
										</div>
									</div></br>
									<h3>Monitoring Success:</h3>
									<p>To monitor success of this intervention, staff-to-patient ratios and death counts should be monitored at either
										selected hospitals in each state, or at an appropriate number of hospitals and clinics in states of highest priority.
									</p>
									<blockquote><h4>Retrospective:</h4>
										<p>I was given the data for this project, so I had to form a hypothesis and conduct an analysis that could be explored with the given data.
											If I were to continue this project, I would start a new phase where I would explore different factors that may affect staffing shortages
											during flu season, such as flu vaccination rates, clinic visits and hospitals stays not leading to death, regions with higher populations 
											of individuals with underlying health conditions, and other possible factors. Of course, these contributing factors would necessitate
											different interventions, such as ensuring greater vaccination rates and sending extra staff to clinics and not just hospitals.
