									<h2>Introduction</h2></br>
									<h3>Problem:</h3>
									<p>Instacartâ€™s sales were doing well, but to continue to grow, the grocer needed to understand the purchasing behavior of different customer segments. Before conducting by analysis, I examined customer goals and objectives.
									</p>
									<h3>Context:</h3>
									<p>I carried out this analysis as a student for a project in CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program. The purpose of this project was to become familiar with Python skills commonly used by data analysts. </p>
									<h3>Goal:</h3>
									<p>The goal was to help the client reach the right customers at the right time with the most effective advertising and marketing strategies. 
									</p>
									<h3>Customer Objectives:</h3>
									<p>These are customer questions and concerns I took into account before conducting the analysis. These questions were especially important to process steps 5-7 found in the process section below.</p>

									<h3>Process Details:</h3>
									<p>This is an example of creating new variables (process step 5 above). This allowed me to create new columns within the data set to be able to visualize the data by different categories. Here, I began by using Python code to divide the data set records by customer region. I then made visualizations based on customer region. I went through a similar process to categorize the data by other categories, such as customer age, family size, frequency of placed orders, and so on.</p>
									<pre><code>Northeast = ['Maine','New Hampshire','Vermont','Massachusetts','Rhode Island','Connecticut','New York','Pennsylvania','New Jersey']
Midwest = ['Wisconsin','Michigan','Illinois','Indiana','Ohio','North Dakota','South Dakota','Nebraska','Kansas','Minnesota','Iowa','Missouri']
South = ['Delaware', 'Maryland', 'District of Columbia', 'Virginia', 'West Virginia', 'North Carolina', 'South Carolina', 'Georgia', 'Florida', 'Kentucky',
'Tennessee', 'Mississippi', 'Alabama', 'Oklahoma', 'Texas', 'Arkansas', 'Louisiana']
West = ['Idaho', 'Montana', 'Wyoming', 'Nevada', 'Utah', 'Colorado', 'Arizona', 'New Mexico', 'Alaska', 'Washington', 'Oregon', 'California', 'Hawaii']

df_all.loc[df_all['state'].isin(Northeast), 'region'] = 'Northeast'
df_all.loc[df_all['state'].isin(Midwest), 'region'] = 'Midwest'
df_all.loc[df_all['state'].isin(South), 'region'] = 'South'
df_all.loc[df_all['state'].isin(West), 'region'] = 'West'

										<blockquote><h4>Comparing Two Variables at Once:</h4>
										<p>When comparing two flags or categories at once, crosstabs, clustered bar charts, and heatmaps were quite helpful. Referring to the images below, the crosstab function in Pandas (a Python library) was used to count the number of items purchased by looking at two categories, region and customer income, while the clustered bar chart visualized this relationship. The heatmap was also used to show items purchased by region and grocery store department.</p></blockquote>

									</section>
									<blockquote><h4>Surprising Results:</h4>
									<p>When I compared two or more variables at once, they seemed to be independent of one another. For example, if I looked at region and department, the popular departments in each region were the same as the population as a whole. All relationship pairs in the data set followed this pattern, whether it was income category and department or any other relationship pair.</p></blockquote>

									<h2>Recommendations</h2></br>
									<h3>Primary Customer Demographics & Product Information:</h3>
									<p>Boost sales by advertising during slower days of the week and times of day, </br> which is Tuesday & Wednesday in the early morning and in the evening </br>starting after 5 p.m. Target the demographics responsible for the most sales </br>during this time. See description below.
									</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<ul>
												<li>Young & middle-aged customers</li>
												<li>Mid-sized families (1 or 2 children)</li>
												<li>Middle income customers</li>
												<li>South and western customers</li>
												<li>Regular & frequent customers</li>
												<li>Mid- & low-range priced products</li>
												<li>Popular departments: produce, dairy/eggs, 
												</br>snacks, beverages, frozen, pantry</li>

									<h3>Most Frequent Shoppers:</h3>
									<p>Frequency is the time duration since a customer's previous order. Here are </br> the insights and recommendations regarding frequency.</p>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
											<ul>
												<li>Young adult and medium-sized households are the most frequent shoppers.</li>
												<li>To encourage other customers to shop more frequently, offer coupons, sales, and free gifts with purchase with quickly approaching expiration dates to the following groups: middle-aged and older adults, childless and large households.</li>
											</ul>
										</div>
									</div>
									<h3>High Rollers:</h3>
									<p>Customers are more likely to spend liberally in the middle of the night and early morning hours on the </br>weekend. Run ads and offer discounts for high-range priced products during the weekend between 3 and 7 a.m.
